            These Terms & Conditions ("Terms") apply to all contracts, sales, and promotions offered by All Seasons Living Australia Pty Ltd ("we," "our," or "us"). By engaging our services or purchasing our products, you agree to the following:
          </p>

          <h2>1. Application of Terms</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>These Terms govern all agreements for the supply of our products and services.</li>
            <li>Any quotation, order form, or written agreement provided by us forms part of the contract.</li>
            <li>If there is any inconsistency, the written contract or order form takes priority over these Terms.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Products & Services</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Samples provided are for guidance only. Variations in colour, finish, and materials may occur.</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for rectifying existing site issues (e.g. structural defects, underground obstructions, prior poor workmanship) discovered during installation. Additional costs may apply if such issues affect delivery or installation.</li>
            <li>Estimated delivery and installation dates are indicative only. While we use best efforts to meet them, delays may occur. Time is not "of the essence" unless agreed in writing.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>3. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
          <p>You agree to:</p>

            <li>Provide clear and safe access to the site for delivery and installation.</li>
            <li>Ensure all required approvals, permits, or strata/council permissions are obtained before works commence.</li>

          <p>We will not be liable for damage, delay, or extra cost caused by failure to meet these obligations.</p>

          <h2>4. Pricing & Payment</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Prices include GST unless otherwise stated.</li>

            <li>Late payments may result in suspension of works and interest being charged on outstanding amounts.</li>
            <li>Title in goods remains with us until payment is received in full. Risk passes to you upon delivery or completion of installation.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>5. Orders & Cancellations</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>An order is only binding once accepted in writing by us.</li>
            <li>Deposits are non-refundable if you cancel after acceptance, except where required by law.</li>
