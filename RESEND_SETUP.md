## Step 2: Verify Your Domain

For emails to work properly, you need to verify your domain:

1. In Resend dashboard, go to **Domains**
2. Click **"Add Domain"**
3. Enter: `allseasonsliving.com.au`
4. Resend will show you DNS records to add

**Add these DNS records to your domain:**
- **DKIM** records (usually 3 TXT records)
- **SPF** record (TXT record)
- **DMARC** record (TXT record - optional but recommended)

**Where to add DNS records:**
- Log into your domain registrar (where you bought allseasonsliving.com.au)
- Go to DNS settings
- Add the records Resend provides
- Wait 10-30 minutes for DNS propagation

### For Vercel Production:

1. Go to https://vercel.com/
2. Select your project: **asl-website**

## Troubleshooting

### Not receiving emails?

**Check:**
1. **Spam folder** - Resend emails might go to spam initially
2. **Domain verification** - Make sure DNS records are added and verified (green checkmark in Resend)
3. **API key** - Verify it's correctly added to Vercel environment variables
4. **Deployment** - Redeploy your Vercel site after adding the API key
5. **Logs** - Check Vercel function logs for errors

### How to check logs:

1. Go to Vercel dashboard â†’ Your project
2. Click **Deployments** â†’ Latest deployment
3. Click **Functions** â†’ Find `/api/submit-lead`
4. Check for errors or email sending confirmations
